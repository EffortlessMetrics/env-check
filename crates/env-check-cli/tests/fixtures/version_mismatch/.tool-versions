# Tool with a version constraint that won't match (nonexistent tool with impossible version)
# This tool doesn't exist, so we get a "missing" rather than "version mismatch"
# For a true version mismatch, we need a tool that exists but has wrong version
# Since we clear PATH, we use a tool that requires a very high version that nothing could satisfy
